# Spectre
Built to use Spectre CSS. A Lightweight, Responsive and Modern CSS Framework.

## Features
1. CDN and local sub-theme option
2. Minimalistic approach with just a few templates overrides and preprocess
3. Implement most needed feature from Spectre.css as form elements, menu
   pages, status messages, etc..
4. No javascript included   

## Installation
Install as any Drupal 8 contrib theme. By default base theme is using CDN
version.

## Sub-theme
Inside folder sub-themes exist two examples of sub-theme for Spectre.
One with CDN integration, and one with local CSS. To use with local CSS
you need to download Spectre.css files and put them in folder assets/spectre inside
your sub-theme.

When you build your sub-theme you can use libraries-overrides for changing
CDN version which is used, or to swap libraries as you needed.

# Spectre
Built to use Spectre CSS. A Lightweight, Responsive and Modern CSS Framework.

## Features
1. CND and local subtheme option
2. Minimalistic approach with just few template overrides and preprocess
3. Implement most needed feature from Spectre.css as form elements, menu
   pages, status messages, etc..
4. No javascript included   

## Installation
Install as any Drupal 8 contrib theme. By default base theme is using CDN
version.

## Subtheme
Inside folder subthemes exist two examples of subtheme for Spectre.
One with CDN integration, and one with local CSS. To use with local CSS
you need to download Spectre.css files and put them inside assets/spectre inside
your subtheme.

When you build your subtheme you can use libraries-overrides for changing
CDN version which is used, or to swap libraries as you needed.
